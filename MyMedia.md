# Sushmitha
One of my preferred songs is __Oke oka Jeevitham__ from the movie __Mr. Nookayya__ .I often listen to this song when I experience loneliness or feel down. The lyrics, penned by Ramajogayya Sastry, convey profound meanings about life's purpose, guiding us on facing societal challenges. Sung by Haricharan and composed by Yuva Shankar Raja, this song holds a special place for me.
